6.  **Generate Laravel application key:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

7.  **Run database migrations and seeders:**

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

8.  **Compile assets (frontend):**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    ```

## Environment Setup

*   **Google Business Profile API:**  Set up a Google Cloud project and enable the Google My Business API.  Obtain OAuth 2.0 client credentials (client ID and client secret).
*   **Yelp API:** Create a Yelp developer account and obtain an API key.
*   **Facebook API:**  Create a Facebook app and obtain an app ID and app secret.
*   **Geolocation API:** (e.g., Google Maps API) Obtain an API key for address validation and geocoding.
*   **NLP Microservice:**  Set up and run the NLP microservice separately (if using). Ensure it's accessible at the URL defined in `NLP_SERVICE_URL`.
*   **Laravel Echo Server:** Configure and start Laravel Echo Server for real-time communication. Follow the instructions in the Laravel documentation.  `laravel-echo-server start`
*   **Queue Worker:** Start the Laravel queue worker to process background tasks: `php artisan queue:work`

## Development Workflow

1.  **Start the Laravel development server:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    php artisan serve
    ```

2.  **Start the React development server:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    ```

3.  **Develop features, write tests, and commit changes.**

4.  **Use Git for version control.**

5.  **Create pull requests for code reviews.**

## Testing

*   **Backend (Laravel):** Utilize PHPUnit for unit and feature testing. Run tests using: `php artisan test`
*   **Frontend (React):** Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and component testing. Run tests using: `npm test # or yarn test`
*   **End-to-end testing:**  Consider using Cypress or similar tools for end-to-end testing.

## Deployment

1.  **Build the frontend for production:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run build # or yarn build
    ```

2.  **Deploy the Laravel backend to a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).**

3.  **Configure the web server to serve the frontend build files (located in `frontend/dist`).**

4.  **Set up a MySQL database on the production server and update the `.env` file with the correct database credentials.**

5.  **Ensure Redis is running on the production server and accessible to the Laravel application.**

6.  **Configure a queue worker to process background tasks (e.g., using Supervisor).**

7.  **Set up monitoring and logging.**

8.  **Secure the application with HTTPS.**

## Monetization Strategy

The application will use a subscription-based pricing model, tiered by:

*   **Number of listings managed:**  Different pricing tiers based on the number of business listings a user can connect and manage.
*   **Included features:**  Higher tiers include more features like review monitoring, content generation, and competitive analysis.
*   **Support level:**  Premium support options will be available at higher tiers.

A free trial period with limited features will be offered to allow potential customers to experience the value of the platform.
